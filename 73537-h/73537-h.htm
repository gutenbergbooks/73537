<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_EARLY_NOVELS_OF">THE EARLY NOVELS OF<br>
JAMES FENIMORE COOPER (1821–1831)</h2>
</div>

<p>James Fenimore Cooper—so the popular legend runs—was
a man who wrote stories about idealized Indians and the wilderness,
now read mainly by boys; who created Leatherstocking,
the man without a cross; and who spent an irascible old age winning
petty lawsuits. Further reflection may call to mind that he
was enamored of the sea as well as of the wilderness, and that one of
his stories had something to do with a spy. All this, of course, is
true; but that Cooper did much more than this, has been discovered
comparatively recently. The explanation is to be found,
in part, in the fact that after Cooper’s death in 1851, the vogue of
his type of romance having passed also, his popularity suffered a
decline reaching its lowest ebb between 1870 and 1880. Another
reason is that the novelist’s dying injunction that no biography be
authorized was carried out so literally by his oldest daughter and
literary executrix that many family papers of value were destroyed.
She afterwards published in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for 1887 two
reminiscent articles about her father, but these are rambling and
uninformative in character. In 1883—thirty years after the death
of the novelist—Professor Lounsbury succeeded surprisingly well
in piecing together the outward facts of Cooper’s life.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The
“Correspondence of Cooper,” just published,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> reveals little about
the workmanship or about the personality of the novelist, except
by way of emphasizing the fact that his social and political ideas
meant more to him than his art. Cooper’s own introductions,
added to his works in 1849, the articles by his daughter, and the
results of Lounsbury must suffice for the external evidence on
Cooper’s work; whatever conclusions are reached on internal evidence
may be modified when materials still in the possession of the
Cooper family are given up to the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>Of the critical writings concerning Cooper the best is an
essay by W.&nbsp;C. Brownell in <i>American Prose Masters</i> (1909), in
which he applies the canons of criticism to the works of Cooper
<i lang="la">in toto</i> under the captions: Form and Substance, Defective Art,
Romantic Realism, Indians, Characters, Women, and Patriotism.
John Erskine in <i>Leading American Novelists</i> (1910), pp. 51–130,
has taken up in greater detail the leading works, using the critical-historical
method. Carl Van Doren in <i>The Cambridge History of
American Literature</i>, I, 293–306, and <i>The American Novel</i> (1921),
Chapter 2, follows somewhat the same method as Erskine. W.&nbsp;L.
Cross in <i>The Development of the English Novel</i> (1899) has a brief
but pointed six pages on Cooper and his relation to Scott and his
successors. These critics think highly of Cooper’s work but have
been interested primarily in Cooper’s results rather than in the
history of how Cooper produced his results. Only Brownell and
Erskine incidentally, and Cross briefly, touch upon Cooper as an
historical novelist. Leaving Cooper’s other historical work out of
account, they concentrate upon <i>The Spy</i>, declaring it an historical
novel of adventure, as Cooper had not the background for genuine
historical work and did not test his fictitious characters in great
historical crises such as in <i>Kenilworth</i> or <i>The Abbot</i>. This seems
a too arbitrary restriction of the term “historical,” for which
Brownell makes some amends when he declares that the alliance
of romance with reality in Cooper’s tales, “his general and personal
interest in the life he depicted makes his account of it solider
art, gives his romance even more substance and meaning than
Scott’s historiography.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> How extensively and well Cooper portrayed
the setting of a past time, how he related his work to his
public, what connection it had with the work of his predecessors
and contemporaries, the consequent originality of his contribution,
and the nature and extent of his influence on the historical novel
have received insufficient attention.</p>

<p>Considering the results of the experiments with native material
outlined in the preceding chapter, Cooper might well have entered
with diffidence upon the task of writing an “American”
novel. That he was in any definite sense aware of the work of his
predecessors in the field of the American novel seems doubtful.
His had been a frontiersman’s boyhood, followed, after an erratic
two years at Yale, by apprenticeship at sea and a decade as a country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
squire. Then by the merest chance he fell into authorship.
To make good his boast that he could write a better book than the
novel of English society life which he was at that time reading,
he wrote <i>Precaution</i>, a story of earls and dukes. But knowing how
devout an American Cooper was, some of his friends made it a
matter of reproach that he should have written a novel foreign
in substance and feeling. He acknowledged the justice of the
imputation and resolved to atone by inflicting upon the world and
himself, as he said, a second book,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> <cite>The Spy</cite>, the patriotic nature
of which should admit of no cavil.</p>

<p>From the writing of <i>Precaution</i>, Cooper carried over very
little save ability to manipulate a story. It taught him nothing
in the way of adapting the formula of the current novel to the
treatment of native material. He had still to learn to conform to
the principles of the Waverley novels and at the same time to find
a tractable American theme. What was the nature of the historical
novel then current?</p>

<p>“Scott had gathered up,” says Dr. Loshe,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “and recombined,
according to formulas of his own, many elements present in the
fiction of his day,—the tendency to localized or national tales
with that interest in humble personages on whom local characteristics
are most deeply impressed, which appears most plainly in
Miss Edgeworth’s Irish stories; the interest in romantic landscape
and word-painting of natural scenery which found its most
striking expression in Mrs. Radcliffe’s theatrical yet impressive
scenes; the tale of adventure reinforced by the revived interest
in travel and antiquarian taste for old buildings and trappings;
and the eagerness for an imaginative interpretation of history
which had expressed itself in many would-be historical tales,
whose hopeless inaccuracies had a naive honesty of good intention.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>These ingredients which Scott had mixed in varying proportions
in his different works, it occurred to Cooper, might be adapted
to native manners and conditions.</p>

<p>The essential requirement of the Scottish novels—conflict,
patriotic association, and difference in social manners—obviously
suggested to Cooper the American Revolution as the scene for his
novel. The details of that warfare, particularly as they were
related by the aged participants in Westchester County, New
York, where he was at this time living, Cooper had listened to
with that intelligent interest with which a seaman may follow
strategy on land as well. He knew this neutral ground, between the
British in New York City and the American army in the highlands
of the Hudson, over which the tide of battle had ebbed and flowed,
as Scott knew his native heath. As he turned over in his mind the
possibilities afforded by this setting he recalled an anecdote which
his neighbor John Jay had related years before concerning a shrewd,
unselfishly patriotic spy employed by him during the war. This
“legend” became the nucleus of his story. Judging from internal
evidence, Cooper must have been delighted with the possibilities
of the subject for was it not still a matter of record how the sensibilities
of the public had been wrought upon by the fate of Hale
and of Andre?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Was not his friend, Dunlap attracting multitudes
to his play, entitled <i>Andre</i>? It next occurred to him to present
his spy in the guise of a pedlar such as Edie Ochiltree, who had
fascinated readers of <i>The Antiquary</i>. So vividly did Cooper realize
his conception of Harvey Birch that the romance had all the semblance
of a memoir.</p>

<p>The public veneration for Washington required that he be
introduced somehow. In 1780 the patriot army, under General
Washington, occupied a line of connecting positions extending from
Philadelphia across northern New Jersey, to the fortified post of
West Point on the Hudson. Along the Hudson River, the American
lines extended to Peekskill, and outposts patrolled the country
as far south as Tarrytown. From this point to the channels which
separate Manhattan Island from the mainland, a distance of about
forty miles, lay the “neutral ground,” the No Man’s Land of the
Revolution. It was the object of the patriot army to prevent the
British forces from drawing supplies from this region, but Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
would not permit devastation. Consequently, the “neutral
ground,” swept by constant raids, and exposed to the unchecked
evils of civil war, became the abode of the lawless and adventurous
spirits who flourish best in times of upheaval and disorder. The
fall of Charleston, the treason of Arnold, and dissensions among
officers of the Continental Army made a general disintegration of
that military force which was the sole support of the patriot cause
seem at hand. The Revolution was in danger, not only from avowed
Tories but from lukewarm followers anxious to keep on the winning
side. This combination of circumstances suggested to Cooper the
military situation in 1780 in the Neutral Ground as the most
suitable background for his story.</p>

<p>Romantic themes were for Cooper more important and
interesting than restoration of the historic past. The instinctive
Toryism that made it natural for Scott to poetize history had no
counterpart in Cooper’s rationalized liberalism.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> But it was not
necessary for his mind to be saturated with history as was that of
Scott. Compared with Europe, America had little history, and
that little Cooper knew, particularly as it pertained to New York.
In the present instance, he had his information from eye-witnesses
and from nine years’ residence on the scenes. It was decidedly to
Cooper’s advantage to have a “legend,” or the outline of a plot,
suggested to him, since, with this in mind, he could in unfolding
a story give to it all the illusion of reality. “Perhaps by chance,”
says Carl Van Doren, “Cooper here hit upon a type of plot at
which he excelled, a struggle between contending forces, not
badly matched, arranged as a pursuit in which the pursued are,
as a rule, favored by the author and reader.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> High and low
characters could easily be borrowed, in fact, his public expected
that. The Wharton family, consisting of a high-spirited young
blond, a faded elder daughter, a young officer, and a feeble father
was the conventional novel family; the pedlar as the central link
of the action came from <i>The Antiquary</i>; Dr. Sitgreaves was an
imitation of Scott’s pedants; Betty Flanagan, the sutler, partook
of the nature of Miss Edgeworth’s Irish characters of low life;
the negro was an adaptation of the court fool; the remaining
characters were be-captained and be-majored as was fitting in a
tale of love and war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>As much of his public was Tory, and as even English readers
might be appealed to, Cooper faced the problem of writing his
story so as to please the patriot and to enlist the interest of these
others besides. Fortunately for Cooper, and for art in American
historical fiction, his training under an Anglican tutor and his
marriage into a Tory family restrained him from such partiality
for the Americans as the first historical novelist might easily have
indulged in and thereby set the standard for succeeding writers.
Cooper’s solution in taking a house divided against itself, in a
section supposedly neutral but actually overrun by skirmishing
parties of either side, supplied also the essential element of conflict.
He added suspense by the uncertainty he created in the
reader’s mind as to which party the spy served and by having him
persecuted equally by bands of Skinners and by Cowboys. With
the sketch of the depredations of the Skinners he enlisted Tory
approval of the veracity of the picture. The first volume was in
fact as inviting to loyalist as to patriot. The mysterious Harper,
though he inspired considerable awe, had little in his reticent
demeanor to indicate that he was the commander-in-chief of the
continental troops. But the patriotic purpose of the book was not
to be lost sight of. In his very persecutions the spy was becoming
heroic, and there could be no mistake as to his position in the outcome.
By making the heroine, regardless of her Tory family,
espouse the American cause, and by exposing as a bigamist the
English colonel, with whom her sister was in love, the author
further won the favor of the patriot. Here and there he added
touches of piety which might bring his fable into favor with the
reader.</p>

<p>The handling of historical matter, particularly the treatment
of Washington, presented a problem of peculiar difficulty.
According to Scott’s practice up to this time, an historical character
must have a minor role. This should have simplified the problem
but Washington was too much venerated to be simply disposed of.
Cooper hit upon the solution of introducing him as the shadowy
Mr. Harper, who looms somewhat gigantically through his disguise,
and is revealed, in the end, as the ally of the spy and the patriot
leader. While Cooper displayed a gift for historical portraiture,
he fell victim to the contemporary notion of Washington and
portrayed him as the sobered and aged President rather than as
the General of the Continental Army. His stiffness <i lang="fr">en famille</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
and his melodramatic skulking about the highlands and in caves
were later by Cooper himself acknowledged a mistake. But to the
general historical facts of his story Cooper was true. Truer, in
fact, than the historians. And this, as has never been pointed out,
constitutes <i>The Spy</i> a document of historical value. For the Whig
historians, following the Revolution, had misrepresented the war
as a united uprising against the mother country instead of the
civil conflict, which, according to the best modern criticism, it
in large part was. The intense Whig tradition begun by Andrews
and Gordon, who based the earliest histories of the Revolution on
Burke’s yearly summaries of the events in the Annual Register,
persisted not only in Weem’s <i>Life of Washington</i> but in Marshall’s
also, and was influential through the ten editions of Botta’s
translation. The federalism of Hildreth (1849) carried on this
bias; and when Bancroft in 1852 reached the Revolution, he broke
all records for a violently partisan and timorously defensive history
of the Revolution.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> For leaving a distinct impression of the
fratricidal nature of the strife, when a just version of the struggle
seemed impossible, Cooper deserves credit hitherto not accorded
him.</p>

<p><i>The Spy</i>, as I have tried to indicate, was in every sense an
experiment. If it succeeded, others of its kind might follow; if it
failed, the American novel would have to wait, for Irving, Cooper’s
only possible competitor, “deliberately chose short stories to avoid
any rivalry with Scott.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> But so well had Cooper estimated the
tastes of the public that the experiment was from the first a success.
In three months it was in its third edition. It won the “respect
of the generally contemptuous English critics,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and the American
press, which had liked the book by instinct, was pleased with
the mild praise as though it were a national tribute.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The happy
issue of the experiment inspirited other native writers; it encouraged
Cooper in particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>For a novitiate like Cooper to follow up at once the career
unexpectedly opened up to him by the success of <i>The Spy</i>, required
that he draw upon material already in hand. His acquaintance
with Westchester county he had used felicitously; there
remained his boyhood at Cooperstown, and his years at sea. Affection
for the pioneer village among the forest-clad hills surrounding
Otsego pressed for utterance and Cooper began “a descriptive
tale” which he named <i>The Pioneers; or, the Sources of the Susquehanna</i>
(1823). With a few Cooperstown characters and the
outlines of a situation in mind, Cooper launched upon the improvisation
of his story. He transcribed and generalized<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> for the
purposes of fiction his memories of the hunter, Shipman, who came
to his father’s, Judge Cooper’s, Hall to present his game; the
motley characters and nationalities of the early settlement; the
town itself as it was forty years ago, with its raw street of wooden
houses; the drunken Indian at the inn; the snowy congregation
crowding to the fire at the church; the seasonal sports of the
rough people; the virgin lake and wilderness, the forest conflagration,
ushering out with grim reality the period of romance. Cooper
was too downright to obscure the grossness of the picture. Derelicts
and scoundrels he well knew were associated with a new society
as much as its idealists, and he brought them in. Representatives
of various social units were made to aid in the evolution of the
plot. Judge Temple, empire-builder, with his daughter just home
from school, and an insurgent young Effingham were given the
center of the stage; Natty Bumppo, protagonist of the advancing
civilization, his companion Chingachgook, christened John, and
various frontier types, were grouped about these.</p>

<p>In this work, Cooper showed a more aggressively American
spirit, derived no doubt from the favorable reception accorded <i>The
Spy</i>. In both the subject-matter and in his presentation of it he
was independent of Scott,—seeking in the picture of American
empire-building and American prodigality to set his country honorably
before foreign readers. As was fitting in an avowedly “descriptive
tale,” he laid aside the “pursuit-rescue” scheme for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
set of sportsman’s sketches not unreminiscent of Irving. Life in
the American Bracebridge Hall<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> was exhibited, with its Christmas
abundance not to be outdone by Irving’s sketch of an English
Christmas, and its sports like the turkey-match, the shooting of
myriads of wild-pigeons, the seining or spearing of bass, the deer-chase
on the lake, maple-sugaring in spring, and sleighing-parties
in winter, each carrying its peculiar appeal. But there was also
dramatic tension and an interest in a theme suggesting Greek
fatalism: the law of nature, embodied in the uncouth old hunter
and the Great Serpent, is seen in conflict with the law of man
represented by the Judge. In the end the law of nature yields
to the stocks and the fire which civilization brought, and the only
escape is a reluctant departure toward the setting sun. A conventional
plot was introduced by Cooper as a concession to his readers,
but it is of secondary importance. A wrong done by Judge Temple
to Effingham’s father is righted by the slightly complicated love-match
of Miss Temple with young Effingham, in fiction a favorite
method of restitution. The girl’s excessive sensibility, the episode
of the panther, the appearance of a sybil, and of a gold-digger,
the hero’s clouded ancestry cleared up in the penultimate chapter,
all are to us dregs in the old wine but gave the story the flavor it
needed in order to sell; the new wine that Cooper introduced has
ripened to modern taste: it is the “essential wonder of pioneer
life” as it is presented in this epic of the wilderness.</p>

<p><i>The Pioneers</i> has never received consideration as an historical
novel. Van Doren speaks of it<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> as Cooper’s first “realistic presentation
of American manners.” Yet a novel of manners it is
not. That life in the frontier town was not what it had been and
never would be again, Cooper realized definitely.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Susan Fenimore
Cooper says,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> “The new narrative, like that which preceded
it, was, in one sense, to be connected with the history of the
country; it should follow the first steps of civilization in its conquests
over the wilderness.” The conceivable contention that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
more than forty years must elapse between the time of the action
and the date of composition is invalid: forty years is exactly the
length of time by which <i>The Spy</i>, generally acknowledged an historical
novel, is separated from its events; and <i>The Antiquary</i>
is remote only twenty-one years. In America, moreover, changes
in manner, customs and outward appearances are so great in a
single generation that the historical romancer need not revert to
antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> It might, further, be argued that no actual historical
character appears in the book. But the contemporary imagination
did not heed to be reminded that here was the story of Daniel
Boone, for to it the story had become a legend.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> There is abundant
evidence that its readers regarded it as an historical novel. So
well did Cooper understand the passing nature of this pioneer life
and so effectively did he characterize it here, that with subsequent
writers the novel of pioneer community life became the characteristic
type of American historical novel.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>In <i>The Pilot</i> (1823) Cooper drew upon his experiences at sea.
How thoroughly he was at home here his biographers have remarked,
but how thoroughly he viewed life from a seaman’s point
of view, they have not insisted upon.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> When it was apparent that
Yale would do him no good, Cooper’s father shipped him before
the mast, and here on his first voyage, which was long and stormy,
occurred an unforgettable chase by pirates and a search by a
British man-of-war. Such adventures were ordinarily discussed
over a cob-pipe, on a wharf-barrel, or, at most, got into chap
books, but no one thought to put them into a novel, for who but
landsmen read novels? Smollett, to be sure, had had sailors but
the detailed maneuvers of vessels and the tang of the old salt he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
had not given. Nor was it done, to Cooper’s thinking, in <i>The
Pirate</i>, which had just appeared anonymously. When he asserted
that it was the work of a landsman and not a of sailor, he was
challenged to make good his contention by writing a story from the
seaman’s point of view. His pugnacious temper was as ready to
take the dare as it had been when it first tripped him into the
authorship of <i>Precaution</i>.</p>

<p>Not unmindful of the experimental character of the venture,
and wise through the unexpected success of <i>The Spy</i>, Cooper determined
to blend nautical fiction and history. “It was conceived
necessary,” says his daughter,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> “to connect with the narrative
some historical name which should give it importance, and for the
same reason, the period of the Revolution was chosen as the date
of the tale. The nautical annals of that time were brief, and a
rapid glance was sufficient to show that among the historical
figures that of the bold adventurer, Paul Jones, stood prominent
as one of the few adapted to a work of fiction. His cruise in The
Ranger suggested the plot of <i>The Pilot</i>.”</p>

<p>The historical facts in brief were these. Jones, after receiving
a lieutenant’s commission in the navy, suggested that the American
vessels, which were few and inferior in comparison with those
of the enemy, should be used as privateers. In the “Ranger” he
captured several trading vessels in the Irish channel; he attacked
his home town of Whitehaven on the coast of Cumberland,
and burned one vessel; he sacked Lord Selkirk’s castle, and defeated
and captured the “Drake,” an English sloop-of-war, with
the loss of only eight men.</p>

<p>Cooper chose the northeastern coast of England as the setting
for his story. This gave him the two-fold advantage of exploiting
sea maneuvers which <i>The Pirate</i> lacked, and of complicating these
with a love story in the castle, which readers of Abbey romances
cherished. In their eagerness to point out its novelty as a sea tale,
students of Cooper have overlooked the Gothic tradition which
<i>The Pilot</i> continued. In the management of the story there was
not so much that was new as might be supposed, for in its general
outlines it was <i>The Spy</i> done in terms of the sea. The skirmishes
of the Neutral Ground became chases between frigates and men
of war, the devotion of Harvey Birch was supplanted by Long
Tom Coffin’s love for the sea, and an incognito Paul Jones replaced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
an incognito Washington. But such economy of creative effort
was justifiable and perhaps necessary for Cooper if he should lavish
upon the details the interpretative sympathy that he was fitted
to give. It was the sailor in him that led the frigate through
the channel in masterful manner and that made his seamen such
likeable fellows. He knew how good sea-dogs would itch for a
fight or boast of their prowess. “Their ships were handled,” says
Captain Mahan, “as ships then were and act as ships still would
under the circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Joseph Conrad has been glad to
acknowledge<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> that Cooper taught him profound sympathy and
artistic insight into the sublimity and mystery of the sea.</p>

<p>Cooper’s choice of the “Father of the American Navy” as
the historical figure with which to connect his sea tale was peculiarly
happy in view of public enthusiasm following the success of
the navy in the War of 1812.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> But in portraying this character
he has been considered no more successful than he had been with
Washington. The statuesque pose of Mr. Gray becomes, through
reiteration, an affectation which it is hard to reconcile with the
fiery Scotchman of history. Cooper himself at a later date expressed
dissatisfaction with the unreality of the portrait.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> It becomes clear
in the course of this story that Cooper regards Paul Jones as a
free-lance whose devotion to America proceeded from his desire
of personal distinction. “A large part of his behavior might be
called Byronic,” Erskine has suggested, “since it appears to be
learned in the general school of the Giaour and the Corsair.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
As an historical document <i>The Pilot</i> has worth because it faithfully
portrays the sea life of the time of the Revolution and because it
has called attention to a phase of the war historians have been
inclined to neglect.</p>

<p>The favor with which Cooper’s three historical novels had
been received convinced him that here lay his field. How seriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Cooper considered himself an historical novelist and how auspicious
were the times for a national romancer has not been understood.
The fiftieth anniversary of the battles of Lexington, Concord, and
Bunker Hill was at hand. The spirit of nationalism was intense.
President Monroe had promulgated his Doctrine, General LaFayette
(a personal friend of Cooper’s) had come to tour the
country he had helped to save, and Daniel Webster in his Bunker
Hill oration was trying to put into pleasing phrase the popular
mood. Cooper, in the blush of popularity, conceived a plan for a
series of historical romances, on a national scale, to be called
“Legends of the Thirteen Republics,” the scenes of which should be
laid in the various colonies that had shared in the Revolution.
The first of this series was devoted to Massachusetts, and was
entitled, <i>Lionel Lincoln, or the Leaguer of Boston</i> (1825).<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>“Nothing that industry could do,” says Lounsbury,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> “was
spared by Cooper to make this work a success. In the preparation
of it he studied historical authorities, he read state papers, he
pored over official documents of all kinds and degrees of dreariness.
To have his slightest assertions in accordance with facts, he
examined almanacs, and searched for all the contemporary reports
as to the condition of the weather. He visited Boston in order to go
over in person the ground he was to make the scene of his story.”
He built his story around the battles of Lexington, Concord, and
Bunker Hill. The entrance of a vessel through the patrolled part
of Boston, carrying young Lincoln, an officer in the British service;
the journey past old North Church, the Province House, and
Faneuil Hall to the heart of the city; the state of unrest among the
citizenry, along with the doubt among the British whether the
rabble will fight; the organization of the Sons of Liberty and the
news of the coming of Clinton, Burgoyne, and Howe; a spirited
account of the running fight from Lexington to Concord; the
uprising of a hundred thousand men under leaders like Warren,
Putnam, and Gage; and at length an account of the Battle of
Bunker Hill, in which the hero is wounded, were put into the first
volume. In the second, history was practically cast to the winds,
and the private fortunes of the hero were related,—his recovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
under the tender ministrations of a girl, his marriage to her, amid
ominous portents, and the disclosure through the spectacular
machinery of Gothic romance of what had been clouded regarding
his ancestry.</p>

<p>For the first time in his treatment of American history, Cooper
had a subject in which he was obliged to substitute for personal
experience painstaking research. Not having been very successful
in handling character that required adherence to historical
fact, it was a question whether his mind could assimilate the
results of his investigations in a way to stimulate rather than to
hamper his imagination. For better or for worse, he made no attempt
to delineate an historical character. Warren, Gage, and
Putnam he mentioned but their possibilities as literary material
he did not recognize; Burgoyne, Howe, and Clinton he misrepresented
in the few pages he allotted to them. With the historical
background in and about Boston he was more successful, giving
according to Bancroft, an effective and truthful rendering. As
heretofore, his sympathy with the losing side equalized the contest
and made it a worthy struggle. For the critical reader none of his
books has a more inviting opening. But Cooper soon found the
attempt to blend his complicated plot of domestic intrigue with
history irksome, and shifted attention to the melodramatic fortunes
of his hero. It is difficult to understand why he should have
made an unheroic English Major the hero of an American story.
It can hardly be explained on the ground of Cooper’s established
antipathy to the New England character, although the fact that
he was too little at home in Massachusetts may have caused him
to piece out the story by giving it a melodramatic turn in keeping
with what was popular on the stage of the day. Mr. Van Doren’s
remark<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> that the book “failed to please as his earlier novels had
done” must be accepted with qualification, as contemporary reviews
vouch for its own popularity as well as for that of <i>The Leaguer
of Boston</i>, a play based upon it.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> It would seem that the “Gothicism”
of the story as manifested in the character of Ralph with
his sudden and apparently unaccountable appearances and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
almost supernatural power over the Byronic Lionel, the spectacular
apparition of an overshadowing arm on the wall of King’s Chapel
during the marriage ceremony, and the sudden death of the
simpleton at the hands of his maniac father who dies with him, was
an element in the historical novel that gave it a contemporary
appeal which has been lost in an age of other critical standards.</p>

<p>When Cooper abandoned after the first attempt his cycle of
thirteen romances of the Revolution, he did not give up his career
in the field of historical fiction. In his next work, <i>The Last of the
Mohicans, a Narrative of 1757</i> (1826), he went back even farther
into his country’s past. In <i>The Pioneers</i> he had sharpened his
tools at frontier material and he now wished to execute a design in
which Indian life should be presented in detail. But comparatively
little was known about the red man at the time. Before the
Revolution he had inspired terror but more recently his melancholy
fate was to a greater or less degree upon the white man’s conscience.
Chateaubriand had given currency to the tradition of the
noble savage, but only an ethnologist like Gallatin or Duponceau
had inquired into his origin, language, religion, ethics, government,
habits and manners, with a sense of their scientific value. Cooper’s
own knowledge of the race was limited to an occasional meeting
with an Indian at Otsego Hall, or a delegation at New York or
Washington. This personal acquaintance he now supplemented,
according to his daughter, by a study of Heckewelder, Colden,
Penn, and Smith.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The setting of his story came to Cooper while in 1824 with a
party of English friends he was on a visit to the Lake Champlain
region. At Glenn Falls one of the party directed his attention to
the caverns in the river as a suitable location for a romance. The
suggestion pleased the novelist, and when the ruins of Fort William
Henry nearby came to mind, it occurred to him to use the episode
of the siege and massacre at the fort during the French and Indian
War as the basis of the story. For the adventures of his fictitious
characters with which Cooper came more and more to occupy the
second volume of his novels, he here fell back upon his “pursuit-rescue”
scheme. He managed this scheme with sufficient adroitness
to display, incidentally, a great variety of Indian customs and
traditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>It is not generally known that Cooper’s Indian was drawn
in large part from Heckewelder.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> This venerable man had been
a Moravian missionary among the Delawares and published some
years later an account which rather idealized them. In view of
this fact, Cooper deserves credit for representing the Indian as
cunning and treacherous as well as generous. When it was objected
that he gave a more favorable picture of the red man than
he deserved, Cooper said:</p>

<p>“It is the privilege of all writers of fiction, more particularly
when their works aspire to the elevation of romances, to present
the beau-ideal of their characters to the reader. This it is which
constitutes poetry and to suppose that the red-man is to be represented
only in the squalid misery or in the degraded moral state
that certainly more or less belongs to his condition, is, we apprehend,
taking a very narrow view of an author’s privileges. Such
criticism would have deprived the world of even Homer.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>What Cooper noted about the red men was their acute senses,
developed through woodcraft and warfare, their belief in omens
and their tortoise and beaver worship, their mummery, their stoiclism,
especially when enduring torture at the stake, their “gift” of
revenge, their war dance, their love of baubles, their respect for
the feeble-minded or the aged, their chaste attitude toward female
captives, the silence of the young, their funeral customs and deference
to the mound for the dead, their councils of war and fierce
tribal pride, their use of metaphorical speech, and the crafty
eloquence of their orators.</p>

<p>In order to show the antitheses in Indian character, Cooper
created in Uncas a noble savage, in conformity with the philosophy
of nature then in vogue, and bestowed upon Magua the deceit and
treachery associated with the Indian when he was a menace.
With his customary repetition of types,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Cooper was inclined to
reintroduce the hunter and his Indian comrade from <i>The Pioneers</i>.
But they were old there and had fallen upon evil days. Yet he
resolved to take the risk. It was a stroke of genius not only to
set them back nearly forty years, but to shown them in the vigor of
manhood undeniably the same individuals. The other characters—an
old man with his motherless two daughters, one of whom is
given in marriage to a representative of the British army for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
devoted services to the family and the other, a quadroon, whose
kidnapping by the Indian villain motivates the pursuit of the
second volume—were redolent of the make-up box and the property-room.
The bore, however, represents a variation from type,
as Cooper intended the half-witted Connecticut psalm-singer
for a modern adaptation of the ministrel of medieval romance.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
The character whose possibilities Cooper now first realized and upon
whom he lavished his devotion was Natty Bumppo. Upon his
Christian stock he grafted many of the virtues of savage life. It
seems to me as if, without consciously doing so, he has blended in
him reminiscences of Sir Charles Grandison and the natural man of
Chateaubriand. In him the historical novel gained a new type of
hero with whose simplicity, downrightness, competence, unsophistication,
and virgin prejudice the natural American has for Europeans
come to be identified.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> How indigenous he was appears
when he is compared with Rip Van Winkle and the characters of
Irving. Thackeray declared <i lang="fr">La Longue Carabine</i> one of the great
prizemen of fiction. “He ranks,” said he, “with your Uncle Toby,
Sir Roger de Coverley, Falstaff ... and the artist has deserved
well of his country who devised them.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The historical element centering about the siege of Fort
William Henry and the subsequent massacre, Cooper might have
gotten up in an hour’s reading. Perhaps its scant basis of fact
accounts for the truth of the picture. Colonel Munro, the English
commander, was “elaborated according to the needs of the plot
and Cooper’s idea of the British soldier of the period,” says
Erskine. “As a soldier he is of course brave, but not astute. Cooper
lets him stand for the usual British incapacity to cope with the
Indians which Braddock so fatally illustrated.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> It is not likely
that any of Cooper’s readers would have impugned the conception.
The portrait of Montcalm is, in my judgment, Cooper’s
best picture of an historical character.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Deeply regretting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
history would perpetuate only his glorious death on the Plains of
Abraham,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Cooper without pronouncing final judgment upon his
conduct, represented Montcalm as putting policy above moral
principle when he did not, by restraining his Indian allies, prevent
the massacre which followed the capitulation of the English. In this
position he was in accord with Timothy Dwight,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> a careful historian,
who remembered the event as a child and expressed the view
which prevailed in New England and New York. The massacre
itself, with its opportunity for pageantry in Scott’s vein, did not
fire Cooper’s imagination.</p>

<p>What Cooper did in <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> that he had
not done so well in his previous historical novels, was to make
the central theme, the conquest of the Indian by the white, turn
upon and be explained by the chief historical event of the book,
the savagery of the red men at Fort William Henry. He achieved
a skillful blend of research and fabrication that has resulted in
its being regarded the best treatment of the ominous theme of race
conflict. Whatever case the critics may have made against his
Indians, and of late they have rather deferred to him, his conception
of the red man has been effective and is not likely now to be
replaced. When people wish to know what it was to live in the
days when the aborigines were in power, it is to this story of disastrous
chances, of hair-breadth ’scapes, and moving accidents by
flood and field, that the imagination naturally turns.</p>

<p>So well was <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> received at home and
abroad that Cooper was moved to write at once another tale of the
Indians. The character of Leatherstocking had grown upon him
and he was ready to hazard a third venture with him. The popular
mind had followed the removal of his prototype, Daniel Boone, to
the plains beyond the Mississippi and the report of his recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
death there. In that mysterious Louisiana Purchase, moreover,
new pioneers were seeking to satisfy their hunger for land. Cooper
also knew, though this has not been pointed out before, that the
public mind was further directed to this frontier by the proposal
by act of Congress to remove the Indians to this territory. These
considerations caused Cooper, although he had never seen the
plains, to determine upon a western setting for his next story,
<i>The Prairie</i> (1827).</p>

<p>“During the spring of 1826 Cooper followed a deputation of
Pawnee and Sioux from New York to Washington to study their
origin for <i>The Prairie</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The sources which he drew upon Cooper
never indicated directly but it may be pretty safely inferred that
he looked into the Journals of Lewis and Clarke, that he used
Long, and perhaps saw Mackenzie.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> From these he learned of the
wild horses, the buffalo herds, the prairie dogs, flocks of migratory
birds, prairie fires, and mounted Pawnee, Tetons, Konzas, Omahas,
and Osages that were to be found on these endless plains. Among
these he placed a squatter from Kentucky, treking with his family
and brother-in-law by prairie schooner across the Nebraska
prairie.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> As Cooper knew nothing of the life at first hand he was
obliged to draw upon his imagination more largely than heretofore.
This he did as easily in Paris where he was at the time residing
as he might have done at home in New York. As usual he
reintroduced many of his characters from his preceding work.
Hawkeye reappeared as the aged trapper, given somewhat more to
moralizing.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> Mahtoree was a slightly milder Magua mounted on
horseback. The Pawnee Hard Heart was another Uncas, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
psalmist became a pedant in search of genus and species. The
lovers were already married and were kept in the background.
The “pursuit-rescue” device to advance the plot was continued
but was employed with less vigor. In every way the tone of the
story is a more subdued one. Only an assault by Indians, a stampede
by buffalo, the prairie fire, and the consternation over the
treachery of the brother-in-law disturb the author’s brooding
over the epic-vastness of the plains.</p>

<p>Whatever Cooper may have owed to Scott at the beginning
of his career, he owed little to him now. His poetical rendering of
the prairie landscape with its elemental figures was a far cry from
the landscapes of Scott in the style of Mrs. Radcliffe and from his
treatment of characters. Perhaps the greatest change of all was in
Cooper’s central figure, the squatter. Instead of making him
heroic, Cooper showed him untroubled by vision, restless to shake
off the restraints of law and society. His wife, “a shabby, inarticulate
prairie Hecuba,” was Cooper’s first attempt to depict the
wife or mother, and has remained, with Ruth in <i>The Wept of
Wish-ton-Wish</i>, his most noteworthy portrait of a woman. Although
Cooper’s story went back but twenty-three years, its manners
were those of a time and condition remote from his own.
Constructed as it was from historical sources it has further qualification
for inclusion here. Its poetic rendering of the atmosphere
of that time and place has given an effective if not accurate idea of
the prairie, an idea which Easterners have until recently retained.</p>

<p>Cooper’s next novel, <i>The Red Rover</i> (1828), was perhaps
his best sea tale but it was not historical, all details having been
invented “without looking for the smallest aid from traditions or
facts.” Hard upon it came another Indian tale, <i>The Wept of
Wish-ton-Wish</i> (1829). In this novel Cooper turned aside from his
Leatherstocking series, for such his Indian tales had come to be,
to the red man’s last stand against his white opponent in New
England in the seventeenth century. Some of his imitators,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
Miss Child, Mrs. Cheney, and Miss Sedgwick, had directed attention
to early New England life, and Cooper now turned in the same
direction, selecting the period of King Philip’s war as the basis for
his novel of Puritan life. The account of Eunice Williams’s Indian
captivity at Deerfield had become classic, and Increase Mather and
Hubbard had each given his narrative of the Indian war with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
bias of those who knew the “heathen” chiefly as an enemy. Irving’s
short tale, <i>Philip of Pokanoket</i> (1814) had served as a corrective
to this legend. The episode of Goffe, the regicide, had been
treated by Stiles in his <i>History of the Judges</i>. In fiction, James
McHenry, one of Cooper’s earliest imitators, had dealt with Goffe
in a Gothic romance, <i>The Spectre of the Forest</i> (1823). Scott in his
<i>Peveril of the Peak</i> (1823), had called attention to it.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> As a national
romancer, Cooper doubtless felt it incumbent upon him to make
yet another excursion into New England material.</p>

<p>In the arrangement of his story, Cooper reversed his usual
plan, by making the first half almost wholly fictitious, and putting
into the last half the historical material concerning Goffe, and the
extermination of Philip’s Indian cohorts. The leading episode of
the first volume, an Indian assault upon a settler’s block-house,
was probably suggested by the analogous attack on the feudal
castle in <i>Ivanhoe</i>. Cooper found it difficult to supply a central
character as the Puritans were to him uncongenial. In Captain
Heathcote he created a man of piety, forced to the Connecticut
frontier by disagreeable and petty religious squabbles. The story
deals with his domestic life, his constant fear of attack, and the
final assault of Indians who destroyed his home and kidnapped his
daughter. It also treats of a general renewal of hostilities after an
interval of several years during which American enterprize built
up the village of Hartford; of the timely warning by the mysterious
stranger, resulting in the overthrow of Philip; and of the restitution
of the wept-for daughter who clings to her Indian mate.
For the historical background Cooper selected, probably from
Trumbull,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> a few items regarding the early settlement of Hartford
in 1635, which he used for the openings of his volumes; and
then, omitting the early years of the war as unsuited to his purpose,
selected for the dramatic climax the final hounding and defeat of
Canonchet in 1675. A mysterious stranger, introduced as Submission,
is employed in the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> to warn the villagers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
final assault in which he meets his death. The reader of <i>The Spy</i>
and <i>The Pilot</i>, already acquainted with Cooper’s <em>method</em> of introducing
historical characters, had no difficulty in recognizing
Goffe, the regicide.</p>

<p>As an historical novel, <i>The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish</i> was a
failure. Cooper was too much a victim of his early bigoted training
to enter with sympathy into the life of the Puritans. Their
religious fanaticism combined with worldly discretion in exploiting
the natives he illustrated repeatedly. The head and front of their
offending he attributed to their hypocritical pastor, the Reverend
Meek Wolfe, who may or may not have been intended as a caricature
of Cotton Mather. On this incapacity of Cooper’s to depict
the founders of New England, Professor Lounsbury has said:
“Paradoxical as the assertion may seem, he was too much like the
Puritans to do them justice;”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> which Professor Erskine has wisely
corrected by adding,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> “In so far as Puritanism coincided with his
nature, he portrayed it admirably in this novel; he lets the reader
see the practical vigor, the exalted piety, and the domestic affection
of Mark Heathcote and his comrades, for these virtues he
can recognize, as he could recognize the common piety and the
common sense of <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. But the mastering vision
that burns like flame in the Puritan temper, impelling it to strenuous
action, was entirely hidden to Cooper, if we can judge by his
writings....” What further contributed to its failure, and
is not so apparent unless approached from the standpoint of the
historical novel is Cooper’s infelicity in dealing with manners so
remote in time. What people wore, apart from broadswords, he
failed to mention. His Wampanoags were fundamentally not
different from the Hurons he presented in <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>.
As in no previous book he frequently lapsed into a strained circumlocutory
style that appears to have been meant for the
picturesque language of old romance.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The braggadocio with
which the second volume, written in Paris, opened, together with
the ill-temper displayed toward the Puritan type, was to bring
Cooper into disfavor at home and abroad. As the next decade of
his work was controversial, or upon European subjects, this chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
may well come to a close here, deferring the discussion of Cooper’s
later, regional novels until some other time.</p>

<p>In the decade from 1821 to 1831—his most fruitful period—Cooper
was more consistently an historical novelist than has been
recognized. In <i>The Spy</i> he represented more fairly than contemporary
historians the actual nature of the Revolutionary conflict.
<i>The Pioneers</i> immortalized the passing of the frontier, while
<i>The Pilot</i> was our first historical novel of the sea. <i>Lionel Lincoln</i>
was an earnest of national romance, to which he returned in
<i>The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish</i>. In <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> he set
down memorably the passing of the first American. America
was his theme, nothing more, nothing less. For this task he lacked
the historical acumen of Scott. Of American history in general
and of New York history, in particular, he had a tolerable understanding.
His life had fortunately been sufficiently varied and
representative not to necessitate getting up his local coloring with
infinite toil. In one or two cases—so rapid were social changes—he
could depend on aged eye-witnesses for a reasonably accurate
idea of a former day.</p>

<p>His American predecessors taught him practically nothing.
From Scott he learned the general formula for his work. Like him
he turned to native scene as the groundwork for his romance.
From him, also, he learned to give larger place to romantic theme
than to restoration of the past. From him he borrowed the ultraromantic
hero and most of the conventional types of character
that he repeated with little variation in successive novels.</p>

<p>But all this was at the beginning. Once started he was less
influenced by foreign authors and subjects than any of his contemporaries.
In his first book he substituted for lairds, a pedlar,
and in place of a castle he used the Wharton farm-house. Save for
his delineation of certain types, his second book was completely
indigenous. In his third, he outdid the Scotchman himself in
giving the very life of the sea. The Gothic tradition which ran
through much of Scott, Cooper retained only in <i>Lionel Lincoln</i>,
finding a more rational substitute in the terror inspired by the
Indians; and, in the mystery of the sea and the wilderness, a new
source of awe. Because he was not steeped in history and because
America’s brief existence did not make it necessary to delve into
antiquity, he substituted adventure for archaism. He showed that
“ivied walls, time-worn castles and gloomy dungeons, were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
necessary to make a land of romance; that the war of the revolution
rivalled, in romantic interest, the war of the crusaders; that
the Indian warrior equally with the turbaned Saracen, was the
theme of the romancer; and that heroes need not always be clad
in iron mail, nor heroines have only knightly lovers sighing at their
feet, or breaking lances and heads to attest their devotion.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
His was the romantic tale of adventure. That is not to say, however,
that “his invention was not without a solid basis; he is not
to be neglected as an historian.... No one fixed the current
heroic traditions of his day more firmly to actual places.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Cooper was prolix, as Scott was prolix, but that, it has been
said, was a secret of his illusion. In technical faults Cooper’s work
abounded; what he enjoyed was to walk cross-country, and little
he cared whether his boots were polished or no. At its best his
style had the rapid motion and color so much needed in the historical
novel of action. Naturally a fighter, he could give his story
the fire and life which such a novel should have. He wrote far
better than was required of him.</p>

<p>While he was not the historical novelist that Scott was, he
was Scott’s most influential successor, and as Thackeray said,
his country deserves well of him. For the epitome in fiction of
early American life one goes not to Irving or Hawthorne but to
Cooper. His representation of it as the conquest of nature by the
pioneer has been considered so characteristic that the historical
novel as he conceived it dominated the writing of American fiction
practically up to the Civil War.</p>

<p>The author of this dissertation, Ernest E. Leisy, was born on
a farm near Mound Ridge, Kansas, December 22, 1887. He was
graduated from the two-year course of the Mound Ridge High
School in 1906, taught public school the following year, attended
Bethel College Academy at Newton, Kansas, from which he was
graduated in 1909, taught public school in 1910–11, attended the
University of Kansas, receiving his bachelor’s degree from this
institution in 1913. He received a University Scholarship at
Harvard where he did graduate work in English in 1913–14. From
1914 to 1918 he was Professor of English at Bethel College, Newton,
Kansas, taking out one year, however, for graduate work in English
at the University of Chicago, from which institution he received
his Master’s degree. Since 1918 he has been an Instructor
in English at the University of Illinois, devoting his spare time to
study toward the doctor’s degree. He has published reviews in
several journals and a short article in <i>Modern Language Notes</i>,
but nothing of importance.</p>

“So little was expected from the publication of an original work of this
description, at the time that it was written, that the first volume of <i>The Spy</i>
was actually printed several months before the author felt a sufficient inducement
to write a line of the second.... As the second volume was
slowly printing, from manuscript that was barely dry when it went into the
compositor’s hands, the publisher intimated that the work might grow to a
length that would consume the profits. To set his mind at rest, the last

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">45</a> The analogy which the spectacle afforded in Cooper’s mind to the
conquest of Canaan, has not been commented upon, but a case can be made
for it from the biblical names he for the first time applied to nearly all the
characters; from the bee-hunter in his land of honey, the encounters with the
“Ishmaelites of the plains,” the Sioux, the stampede of the buffalo furnishing
the terror of wild beasts, and the problem of the Red Sea transformed into
that of prairie fire, with Leatherstocking the Moses to show how to circumvent
this difficulty.</p>
